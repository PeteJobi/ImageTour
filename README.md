Using ImageTour, you can create a video that tours around a large-resolution image, especially for cases where said image is too huge to share. You control the movement by setting multiple points in the image, and the "camera" (a window smaller than the image) moves between these points. You also control the duration of each transition, and the frames per second (fps) of the output video.
